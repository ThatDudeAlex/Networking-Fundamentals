# Networking Fundamentals

A collection of networking and communication projects to learn and explore fundamental concepts in networking, including sockets, protocols, and real-time communication.

Currently, the `TCP Chat Application` is implemented, with more projects planned for future development.

## Projects

### 1. HTTP Server/Client
Implement a basic HTTP server that can handle GET and POST requests, along with a client to interact with it. This project covers:
- Request parsing and response generation
- Socket programming and HTTP protocol
- Handling concurrent client connections

### 2. TCP Chat Application
A simple chat and file transfer application built using Python's socket programming.
- Multi-client support
- Message broadcasting
- File transfer
- Threading for concurrency

ðŸ“– **More Details:** [README](./tpc-chat-app/README.md)

### 3. WebSockets
Develop a WebSocket server and client to explore real-time, bidirectional communication.
- Establishing WebSocket connections
- Sending and receiving messages in real-time
- Handling disconnections and errors

### 4. DNS Resolver
Build a simplified DNS resolver to query for A records and understand how DNS operates.
- Parsing and sending DNS queries
- Understanding DNS hierarchy and response handling
